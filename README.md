# Dress-Anything

Dress Anything is a Deep Neural Network Model based approach which aims to deliver the sense of fitting and trial of cloths on users body virtually.<br><br>
It takes normal photo of user and the dress photo from online shopping app and then neural net does its job by rightly fitting that cloth on users body giving them a taste how that particular outfit will look on them.<br><br>
